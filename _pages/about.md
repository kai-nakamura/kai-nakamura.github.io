I'm a first year grad student at the University of Texas Austin. I am interested in geometry and topology, in particular low dimensional topology with an eye towards symplectic topology. On this website, you'll find information about myself such as my research, CV, and service as well as information for classes I'm teaching.

This Spring 2019 I am TAing for Professor Wolsensky's math 408R

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. This website is under construction at the moment and will be changed significantly
