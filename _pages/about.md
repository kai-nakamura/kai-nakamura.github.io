I'm a first year grad student at the University of Texas Austin. I am interested in geometry and topology, in particular low dimensional topology with an eye towards symplectic topology. On this website, you'll find information about myself such as my research, CV, and service as well as information for classes I'm teaching.

This Spring 2019 I am TAing for Professor Wolsensky's math 408R

I'll be at the following places this summer

  * July 1st - 13th SMS 2019 Current trends in symplectic topology at the University of Montreal
  * July 15th - 19th Perspectives on Dehn Surgery at Brown University
