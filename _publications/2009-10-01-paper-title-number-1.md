abstract: As shown by Donaldson, any symplectic 4-manifold can be blown up to have a Lefschetz fibration which corresponds to a positive factorization of the identity in the mapping class group of the fiber. By finding new positive factorizations one can find constructions of interesting symplectic 4-manifolds and find examples to illustrate the geography of symplectic 4-manifolds. Explicitly, we give an example of a Lefschetz fibration on a space that is homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic to 3CP2#11CP2. This is done by finding a positive factorization of the identity in the mapping class group of a genus 2 surface with 10 non-separating vanishing cyclesand 10 separating vanishing cycles. In doing so, we complete a gap in Baykur andKorkmaz’s geography of genus 2 Lefschetz fibrations on simply connected symplectic 4-manifolds with b+ ≤ 3. Furthermore, we deduce the existence of restrictions on where a genus 2 Lefschetz fibration lays in the geography plane.
